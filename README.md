# Ensemble-Methods-And-Skewed-Data
I used scikit-learn ensemble classes to calculate true positive rate, positive predictive value, and false positive rate in addition to the "usual" accuracy on a dataset that has extremely skewed data.
<strong> Unfortunately, the csv file that goes along with this project is too big to upload, so I will include a Dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/j11azpscm09t439/cc%281%29.csv?dl=0 </strong>

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection. <br>
